# Pomodoro Timer App

This is a simple Pomodoro Timer App built with React. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mciabuca/pomodoro-timer-app.git`
2. Navigate into the directory: `cd pomodoro-timer-app`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the app: `npm start`

## Usage

- Set the session length (the amount of time you want to focus on a task).
- Set the break length (the amount of time you want to take a break).
- Start the timer and it will alternate between the session and break.

## Future Features

- Task tracking: Allow users to enter and track specific tasks during each Pomodoro session.
- Statistics: Show users statistics about their work sessions, such as how many Pomodoros they've completed, total time spent working, etc.
- Notifications: Notify users when a work session or break is over, even if the app is in the background.
